Talk about the work environment at Github. What kind of things do they do and do not to deal with everyday problems.

### Slides

### Notes

- Taking pain away from using internal tools
- Figuring out who is working on what?
	- They use an internal tool that lets them share what they are working on
	- What you are focused right now
	- "We see awesome being shipped so we want to ship awesome!"
	- They use campfire to speak internally
- How they deal with remote workers
	- They facilitate remote users for them to not feel left out
	- They use a unified music streaming that anyone in the world can use to control whatever is being listened on the office in SF
	- All internal apps are developed in iOS and Andoid native as well so that anyone can use them
- Not abuse tools as well. Things like skype meetings and things like that
- Be conscious about the language used. There are a lot of different ways to say the same thing in a way that it won't feel negative on that other person
- There is a shitload amount of interaction across the company in regards to ideas that are put up for evaluation (something like an average of 400 comments per month)
- One of the suggestions if to stop with email communication and bring it to other platforms where you can easily opt-out

### Conclusions

They use a lot of internal tools. Most of them to incentivate social interaction so that everyone know what someone else is doing. There is a big inner communication in engineering and IT team.
They also have a very big control over what kind of rooms are for cats and pugs and what rooms are not, there is a segregation.
